Subject: RRD Java Interface


I spent some time last week searching for an adequate interface for RRD
to Java.  Much to my surprise, I was unable to locate such interface.
Therefore, I took a day and built a low-level interface for Java to
RRD.  I have tested the APIs and everything seems to be in working
order.  I have attached the code and hope that you would include it in
future builds of RRD.  The makefiles are currently built to support
Solaris.  I didn't want to mess with your automake code.

Regards,

Dave
